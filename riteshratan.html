                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm Ritesh Ratan, I am from Varanasi, (Uttar Pradesh), Currently living in Dehradun,(Uttarakhand). I did my schooling from 
                   <a href="https://sainikschoolrewa.ac.in/">Sainik School Rewa</a>, (Madhya Pradesh). Since my young age I have witnessed Armed forces life. I wanted to become a Naval officer
                   after completing my schooling but unfortunately I was not able to crack NDA written examination. Then getting suggestions from
                   my relatives and family I decided to pursue B.Tech. Now I'm very happy with this decision trying my level best to do good in this
                   field. Apart from studies, I enjoy participating in sports activities, I play basketball, I have participated in National Basketball 
                   championship(SGFI). I have also represented my shcool in West-Zone as well as Inter-Zonal Basketball championships.
                   In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends, listening to music, and doing gym.
